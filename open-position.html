  <h3>Postdoc/Research Assistant position in the modelling of multi-strain/multi-pathogen interaction and influenza</h3>
    <p></p>
<p>A postdoctoral position is available within the Team 1 ‘Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Modelling’ of the Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health (IPLESP) part of INSERM. The candidate is expected to work within the framework of the project CompFlu funded by the program Emergence de la ville de Paris with the aim of analyzing the circulation of Influenza in France.</p>

<p>We are looking for a strongly motivated person with excellent skills in computational modeling, data collection and analysis, and a keen interest in multidisciplinary research. The candidate should have a background in quantitative science, such as physics, applied mathematics, computer science, epidemiology or any close related discipline. Proven ability to work independently and to quickly adapt to new scientific environments are essential for this position. Good communicative skills to successfully collaborate with the other members of the group, and a good knowledge of both oral and written English are required.</p>
 
<p>The selected candidate will work in Paris (France). She/he will join the Networks in Disease Ecology group part of IPLESP and will work under the supervision of Dr. Chiara Poletto, and in collaboration with the Team 1 and the Surveillance actors responsible for Influenza surveillance in France. The topics of the work will be marked by the objectives of CompFlu, which include the mechanistic modeling of Influenza spatial spread in the French territory through a computational approach the analysis of surveillance data and the understanding of the dynamics of interaction between influenza sub-types, and the interaction between influenza and other respiratory pathogens including COVID-19. Research tasks will be mechanistic modelling (development of data-driven models, agent-based approaches), computational programming, statistical inference, data analysis. Experience with data-intensive infectious disease modeling, and data analysis is highly desirable. </p>

<p>The position is full-time and fixed-term available for one year in the first instance. Applications will be continuously received and evaluated until the position is filled.</p>

<p><b>Applications should be submitted to Dr. Chiara Poletto via email (chiara.poletto@inserm.fr) and must include:
    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
        <li> letter of motivation;</li>
        <li> CV including the list of publications;</li>
        <li> up to 3 selected preprints/publications most relevant for this position;</li>
        <li> Contact details for 2 referees.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
